Just run npm install and run Gulp watch to compile 
To setup, simply fork the repo and run npm install in order to get all the Gulp dev dependencies. Next, run Gulp watch to compile the Sass and minify the JavaScript. Alternatively, if you don't have Gulp installed globally, you can run the npm script npm run watch. Any changes done to the JavaScript (js/scripts.js) or Sass (sass/styles.scss) will be autocompiled and ready to go.
